This implementation profile of the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is a companion resource to the publication: **[A Framework for Disclosure in Public-Private Partnerships: Technical Guidance for Systematic, Proactive Pre- and Post-Procurement Disclosure of Information in Public-Private Partnership Programmes](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/a-framework-for-disclosure-in-public-private-partnership-projects)**

The [Framework](implementation/ppp_framework/) sets out the information that should be published at key stages of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) programme. The OCDS for PPPs provides a technical specification for how this information can be provided as structured data.

A structured data standard for PPP disclosures enables:

* **Automated verification** of disclosures against the framework requirements;
* Creation of **common tools** to present accessible information on PPPs;
* **Aggregation** of information from different PPPs.

The OCDS for PPPs profile is implemented as a set of extensions to the core Open Contracting Data Standard, along with customised documentation.

You can find an overview of how to make disclosures with OCDS for PPPs in the [getting started](getting_started/) section.

The [implementation guidance](implementation/) section describes practices for publishing OCDS for PPPs. 

View the [schema reference](schema/) for detailed technical information on the data model.


## About

The Public Private Partnerships implementation profile of the Open Contracting Data Standard has been developed in partnership with the Open Contracting Team and Public Private Partnership Team at the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org). 

The Open Contracting Data Standard is a core product of the [Open Contracting Partnership](http://www.open-contracting.org) (OCP). 

Version 1.0 of the standard was developed for the OCP by the [World Wide Web Foundation](http://www.webfoundation.org), through a project supported by the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.com) and the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org). Ongoing development is managed by [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop) under contract to [OCP](http://www.open-contracting.org).

## Support

A [free helpdesk service](support/index.md) is available to support implementation and use of OCDS.
