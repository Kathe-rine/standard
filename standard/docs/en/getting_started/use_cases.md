## Users and use cases

OCDS for PPPs has been designed around one core use-case: ensuring that PPP projects are able to disclose, as structured data, all the information required by the World Bank [Framework for Disclosure in Public-Private Partnerships](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/a-framework-for-disclosure-in-public-private-partnership-projects) 

However, this data is a means, not an end in itself. 

The [Framework](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/a-framework-for-disclosure-in-public-private-partnership-projects) outlined four key drivers for PPP disclosure:

* **Anti-Corruption**
* **Increasing private sector involvement**
* **Increasing public confidence and awareness**
* **Value for money**

The Framework notes that:

*"Other specific factors can be identified under the four broad drivers of disclosure. For example, important factors contributing to an increase in public confidence are (a) aligning private investments with public interest and (b) improving the delivery of public services. Similarly, factors contributing to improved private investment mobilization include (a) the predictability of the PPP pipeline, (b) a level playing field for all bidders, and (c) objective criteria for evaluating bids, among others."*

From these drivers, and our wider research to develop this extension, we have identified a range of users and use-cases for PPP disclosure, including:

* **The private sector** - seeking to identify, evaluate and plan around PPP opportunities;
* **Governments** - seeking to assess PPP modalities, and to monitor implementation;
* **Citizens** - seeking to gain a clear understanding of major projects, and the costs and benefits of PPPs;
* **Media** - reporting on PPPs and investigating the tendering, award or implementation of a project;
* **Researchers** - analysing PPP portfolio's in particular countries or sectors.

When planning your implementation of OCDS for PPPs, consider these use cases, and how the data will be made as useful as possible to these different audiences. This might require attention to priority fields of data, or to how information is written. 

For example, for citizens to gain an understanding of a project, descriptions may need to be carefully and clearly written, and may need to be translated in local languages.
