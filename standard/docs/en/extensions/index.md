# Extensions

OCDS aims to provide a common core of [sections and building blocks](../../../getting_started/building_blocks.md) for describing contracting processes. 

This Public Private Partnership version of OCDS incorporates a number of extensions, designed to model additional requirements from the [World Bank Disclosure Framework for Public-Private Partnerships](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/a-framework-for-disclosure-in-public-private-partnership-projects). 

You can find documentation for these extensions below.
