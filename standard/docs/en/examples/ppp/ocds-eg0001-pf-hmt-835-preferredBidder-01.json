						"description": "This FBC covers:\n\n- The Strategic Case which confirms that the scheme is consistent with and will contribute to, local, regional, and national objectives in transport and other policy areas.\n- The Scheme Description describes the Scheme and the approach to tolling (which is an integral part of the Scheme);\n- The Value for Money Case was set out in the OBC; this FBC provides details of the appraisal of Social and Distributional Impacts (SDIs) for the project;\n- The Delivery Case describes the establishment of the Mersey Gateway Crossings Board, which will be empowered by the Council to discharge its on-going project responsibilities in the post-Contract Award period (in the design and construction phase and in the post-opening operational phase);\n- The Commercial Case demonstrates a sound commercial (business) strategy for managing the Council’s retained risks and a sound procurement strategy and process which has taken a rigorous approach to the private sector’s role in delivering the Project objectives; and\n- The Financial Case details the funding contribution required from DfT and the robust estimates of toll revenue, that the Council is able to meet its own contribution, and that there are robust proposals in place for the management of financial risks, particularly those related to the toll revenue stream.",
